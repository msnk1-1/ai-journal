    This week I used AI to help me with a bunch of small tasks across my classes and RA work.  
    I used it mainly to reword Canvas posts so they sounded more natural and not AI-flagged,  
    and to help me understand topics like composition vs inheritance for our Week 10 discussion.  
    I also used AI to fix up some of my Weekly Activity text, convert a spreadsheet into a PDF,  
    and check the steps for my class project before submitting anything.  
    I still wrote the actual code and did the assignments myself — AI was mostly for explanations  
    and helping me clean up writing.

    I used AI in these chats:  
    <br>
    – ChatGPT conversation for rewriting Weekly Activity 10  
    <br>
    – ChatGPT conversation for composition vs inheritance explanation  
    <br>
    – ChatGPT conversation for converting spreadsheet → PDF  
  </p>
