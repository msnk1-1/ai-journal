📝 Week 6 — AI Usage Journal Entry

Summary of AI Use This Week:
This week, I used ChatGPT (GPT-5) for two main things — creating flashcards to study for my upcoming quizzes and helping me design a new RA event flyer.

For studying, I had AI turn my lecture notes and readings into flashcards so I could quiz myself on key terms, definitions, and main ideas. It made reviewing a lot faster and easier to focus on what I didn’t know well.

I also used ChatGPT to help redesign an RA event flyer. It gave me layout ideas, helped rewrite the event description to sound more engaging, and even suggested color themes that matched the “Fall Into Success” theme.

Reflection:
AI helped me balance both academics and my RA duties this week. The flashcards kept me focused while studying, and the flyer support saved time while making my event look more professional. I’m starting to use AI more as a creative assistant rather than just a writing tool, and it’s been useful for both productivity and presentation.
