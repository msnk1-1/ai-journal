  <h1>Week 9 — AI Usage Journal</h1>

  <p>This week I used AI mostly for my INST326 assignments, including rewriting my polymorphism discussion post, converting Weekly Activity 9 instructions into text form I could paste into Canvas, and simplifying the content so it didn’t get flagged for AI use. I also asked AI to help reword several quiz answers, create a reflection for my discussion reply, and help explain some smaller Python concepts when I was stuck. I documented links to these chats throughout the week and used the tool mainly for explanations, rewriting, and debugging support.</p>
