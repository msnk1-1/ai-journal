    <h1>Week 12 AI Journal Entry</h1>
    <p class="muted">Dec 1–Dec 7, 2025 — Messiah Khalfani</p>

    <h2>Week 12 Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This week, I used AI mainly to help with final projects, formatting assignments for submission,
      and fixing errors in my code and documents. AI saved me time by helping me rewrite responses,
      generate structured content for Canvas submissions, and troubleshoot issues in files I was
      uploading to GitHub and ELMS.
    </p>

    <h2>1. AI for Assignment Rewording &amp; Humanizing Text</h2>
    <p>
      I used AI to rewrite multiple discussion posts and project reflections so they sounded more
      natural and less robotic. This helped me submit clearer responses that kept my original
      meaning but flowed better and matched the casual tone my instructors prefer.

    <h2>2. AI for GitHub &amp; HTML Journal Updates</h2>
    <p>
      I used AI to help update my <code>index.html</code> and organize my AI journal structure by week.
      It helped me format links correctly, connect new week pages, and fix small HTML issues so that
      the journal stayed consistent across all weeks.

    <h2>3. AI for Image Editing &amp; Formatting</h2>
    <p>
      AI also helped me edit screenshots for assignments (changing dates, text, dollar amounts, and
      resizing images properly for submission). That let me clean up files quickly instead of
      redoing the entire document from scratch.

    <h2>4. AI for Project Drafting &amp; Final Submissions</h2>
    <p>
      I used AI to generate project drafts, rewrite summaries, and organize final documents into
      formats that were ready for Word, PDF, and Canvas submissions. I still reviewed and edited
      everything myself, but AI helped me move faster and not get stuck on wording or layout.

    <h2>5. Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Overall, AI was most helpful this week for time management and cleanup work, especially with
      multiple deadlines happening at once. Instead of spending a lot of time on formatting or
      rewriting, I could focus more on reviewing content and actually submitting assignments. I made
      sure the final versions still matched my own understanding and followed the course rules for
      AI use.
