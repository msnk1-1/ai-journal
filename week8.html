      <p class="muted">INST326 · Messiah Khalfani</p>

      <p>This week I used AI mainly to help me understand and organize my approach to inheritance in Python and to prepare my discussion answers. I also used it for debugging and clarifying the difference between inheritance vs composition because that part was still a little confusing at first.</p>

      <h2>How I Used AI This Week</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I asked AI to explain how a base class should be structured in Python, especially when we are using <code>super()</code> and calling parent initializers.</li>
        <li>Got help formatting my Week 8 Discussion post on applying inheritance to my team’s domain project so the explanation was clearer and made sense logically.</li>
        <li>Used AI to check my code comments to make sure they matched the functionality of my methods. Sometimes I change code but forget to update the comment, so I used AI to quickly verify consistency.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why AI Was Helpful</h2>
      <p>It saved time because instead of reading like 4 different StackOverflow threads trying to piece together an explanation, I could ask pointed questions and get a direct breakdown. Also it made debugging calmer because I could describe the error in plain language and get a clear fix.</p>
