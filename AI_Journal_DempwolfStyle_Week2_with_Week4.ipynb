    "- **Encapsulation review:** Asked ChatGPT (GPT-5) to analyze my Binary Search Tree class for encapsulation issues; it flagged that my `root` and `size` fields were public and suggested making them private with getters.\n",
    "- **RA event planning:** Used AI to help write and re-edit the \"Fall Into Success\" event description, adjusting details like the 7 PM start time and removing snack mentions.\n",
    "- **Community mapping bullets:** Generated bullet points for different residents, then had AI refine each one to be unique and fix pronouns without extra spacing.\n",
    "- **GitHub page maintenance:** Got HTML help adding Week 4 to my journal and fixing broken navigation links.\n",
    "- **Small admin edits:** Followed AI’s step-by-step directions to update dates and amounts on flyers and receipts.\n",
    "- **Rewording discussion posts:** Used AI to make my tone more natural and casual (more “and/also”) and to remove flagged academic phrasing.\n",
